About us
We, the BSG Group are aiming to apply knowledge from studying basics of Progressive Web Applications. The BSG group, established in 2018 and composed of nine Bachelor of Science in Information 
Technology third year and fourth year students, who are currently enrolled under the School of Computing and Infromation Sciences, of Saint ouis University. As we strive to make the best that we can,
we have come up with a finish product which is the "Basketball Statistics Generator". The goal of the Basketball Statistic Generator, is to help Basketball facilitators including the 
table officials, coaches and players to make scoring and statistics generating, easier and allow room for improvement as a team or as a player, be seen through the use of 
the Basketball Statistics Generator.
