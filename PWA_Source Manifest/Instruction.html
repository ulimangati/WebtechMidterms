The Basketball Statistics Generator is a progressive web application 
that records the statistics of each player in a team during the game. 
The statistics in the game would be tallied, computed, and sorted. 
Coaches are given a copy of the output and can use these statistics 
to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their team to help the 
coach discuss the next strategy to be attempted for the team and in 
their next following games.
